/**
 **This JUnit 4 class consists of a unit test suite for the CoinSlot class 
 * in the org.lsmr.vending.hardware package, as well as stub inner classes.
 * 
 **Two inner "stub" classes, TestSink and TestCoinSlotListener, are defined.  
 * 
 **CoinChannel is considered a part of the tested "unit", since 
 * CoinSlot.connect() strictly depends on CoinChannel, which is declared Final.
 * >> Similarly, no stub is created for Coin because CoinSlot.addCoin() strictly
 * >> depends on Coin. It could be extended, but that doesn't seem helpful.
 * 
 **Testing Paradigm: 
 * >> The tests are intended to isolate the CoinSlot as much as possible,
 * >> so VendingMachine is not involved. This approach can be thought of like 
 * >> placing the CoinSlot on a workbench and probing it with test devices.  
 * 
 **Assumptions:
 * >* CoinSlot's parent, AbstractHardware, has already been tested so listener 
 * >> registration and device enable/disabling doesn't need to be tested. 
 * >* CoinSlot's constructor "works" and does not need to be tested; just a setter.
 * >* CoinChannel connection can be tested implicitly in other tests 
 * >* Coins "work", including rejection of non-positive values.
 * 
 **Class Organization:
 * >> Fields
 * >> Inner classes
 * >> Setup/tear-down
 * >> Convenience methods
 * >> Test cases
